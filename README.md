FCFS (First-Come-First-Serve):

Average Waiting Time: Calculated as 16.5
Average Turnaround Time: Calculated as 27.0
    
SJF (Shortest Job First):

Average Waiting Time: Calculated as 6.0
Average Turnaround Time: Calculated as 16.5
    
Priority Scheduling:

Average Waiting Time: Calculated as 12.5
Average Turnaround Time: Calculated as 23.0
    
Round Robin (RR) with Time Quantum 4:

Average Waiting Time: Calculated as 8.0
Average Turnaround Time: Calculated as 18.5
Analysis:

SJF (Shortest Job First) performs the best with the lowest average waiting time and average turnaround time, making it the most suitable algorithm for this set of processes.
Round Robin (RR) with a time quantum of 4 provides a fair balance between waiting time and turnaround time, making it a reasonable choice if fairness is a priority.
Priority Scheduling performs better than FCFS but is outperformed by SJF and Round Robin in this scenario.
FCFS (First-Come-First-Serve) performs the worst in terms of both average waiting time and average turnaround time.
