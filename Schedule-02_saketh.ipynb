    "SJF (Shortest Job First) provides the most efficient scheduling with the lowest average waiting time and turnaround time. It prioritizes patients with shorter estimated treatment times, reducing overall waiting times.\n",
    "\n",
    "FCFS (First-Come-First-Serve) has a relatively higher average waiting time compared to SJF, making it less efficient. It schedules patients based on their arrival times, which may lead to longer waiting times for patients with longer estimated treatment times.\n",
    "\n",
    "Priority Scheduling takes into account the urgency level of patients, prioritizing those with higher urgency levels. While it ensures that urgent cases are attended to promptly, it has a higher average waiting time compared to SJF.\n",
    "\n",
    "Round Robin (RR) with a time quantum of 10 minutes provides fair scheduling in terms of waiting time distribution. However, it has a higher average waiting time compared to SJF and may not effectively prioritize urgent cases.\n",
